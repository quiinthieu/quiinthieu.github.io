By analyzing storm event data from 2014 to 2023, we uncovered several important insights that can inform disaster preparedness strategies.\nAnalyze Phase: Uncovering Key Insights Based on our analysis, let\u0026rsquo;s address the key questions we are set out to answer:\nWhat types of storm events are most prevalent in the U.S.?\nThe most common storm events are Thunderstorm Wind, Flash Flood, Hail, High Wind, Drought, Flood, Winter Weather, and Winter Storm. These events occurred frequently across various regions in the U.S. over the ten-year period.\nWhere do storm events most frequently occur?\nTexas emerges as a hotspot, experiencing 46,782 storm events across various types, which is double the count of the next highest state, Kansas.\nAre certain regions more prone to specific types of storm events?\nYes, different regions are vulnerable to different storm types. For example, the Southwest (especially Texas) faces Thunderstorm Wind, Flash Flood, Hail, and Tornadoes, while the West (California) is more prone to Wildfires and Floods. The Southeast (Florida) frequently experiences Hurricanes, Tropical Storms, and Lightning.\nWhat is the temporal distribution of storm events?\nWe observed clear seasonal patterns. Thunderstorm Wind and Hail peak in late spring and early summer. Flash Flood and Lightning events are common in summer. Tornadoes mostly occur in spring, while Hurricanes and Tropical Storms peak in late summer and fall.\nWhat is the impact of different storm events on injuries, fatalities, and property damage?\nFrequent events like Flash Floods cause the most catastrophic property and crop damage. However, less frequent events, such as Hurricanes, result in higher fatalities and injuries, making them high-impact disasters despite their rarity.\nHow can this analysis inform disaster preparedness initiatives?\nInsight 1: Key storm types—like Flash Floods, Tornadoes, and Hurricanes—require special focus in preparedness efforts due to their frequency or high-impact damage. Insight 2: Different regions face different storm threats. For example, the Southwest must prepare for Tornadoes and Flash Floods, while California needs to focus on Wildfires. Insight 3: Seasonal trends must guide disaster preparedness timelines. Hurricanes, for instance, peak in September, allowing stakeholders to plan resources accordingly. These findings provide actionable insights for local and federal agencies to prioritize their disaster preparedness efforts, tailored to specific storm types, regions, and seasons.\nShare Phase: Communicating Insights To effectively communicate our findings, we created visualizations that highlight the key insights from our analysis. These visualizations include:\nBar Charts: Comparing the frequency of different storm types, the impact in terms of injuries, fatalities, and property damage. Choropleth Maps: Showing the distribution of storm events across states. Line Graphs: Illustrating the temporal distribution of storm events. Act Phase: Implementing Disaster Preparedness Strategies Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions to enhance disaster preparedness efforts:\nRegional Preparedness Plans: Develop region-specific preparedness plans based on the prevalent storm types in each area. Early Warning Systems: Enhance early warning systems for high-impact storm events like Hurricanes and Tornadoes. Community Education: Educate communities on storm safety measures and evacuation procedures. Resource Allocation: Allocate resources based on seasonal trends to ensure timely response to storm events. To dig deeper into the data and explore additional insights, we can conduct further analyses, such as:\nIncorporating additional datasets to enrich our analysis. Evaluating the effectiveness of past disaster preparedness initiatives. Predicting future storm events based on historical data. What’s Next? By applying data analysis techniques to U.S. storm event data, we’ve gained valuable insights that can drive more effective disaster preparedness strategies. This analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in addressing real-world challenges.\nWant to dig deeper?

After completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I wanted to dive into a real-world problem—analyzing U.S. storm events. By studying past storm data, we can uncover patterns that help improve disaster preparedness.\nIn this two-part blog series, I’ll guide you through the six phases of data analysis:\nAsk Prepare Process Analyze Share Act Today, we’ll focus on the Ask, Prepare, and Process phases.\nAsk Phase: Defining the Problem Before diving into the data, I started by asking some key questions:\nWhat types of storms are most common? Where do storms frequently occur? Which storms have the greatest impact in terms of damage and fatalities? These questions would guide my entire analysis and help me identify the biggest threats from storms across the U.S. The goal was clear: to uncover insights that could support better disaster preparedness efforts.\nPrepare Phase: Gathering the Data To address these questions, I turned to the NOAA Storm Event Database. This dataset contains records of U.S. storm events from January 1950 to June 2024, detailing everything from location and event type to damage and fatalities.\nThe dataset has 51 columns, each loaded with important data. However, real-world datasets like this are often messy, containing missing or inconsistent values. I knew I’d have to clean it up before performing meaningful analysis.\nProcess Phase: Cleaning and Prepping for Analysis With the raw data in hand, the next step was to clean it up. Here’s how I approached it:\nRemoving Duplicates: I confirmed that there were no duplicate records—always a good starting point! Handling Missing Values: For columns like damage_property and damage_crops, I converted estimates like \u0026ldquo;10K\u0026rdquo; to actual numbers (e.g., $10,000) and imputed missing values as 0. This decision was based on the fact that missing values often indicate that no damage was reported. Tornado-Specific Fields: Fields like tor_f_scale (tornado scale) were only relevant for tornado events, so I left them as missing for non-tornado events. Data Type Conversion: I transformed date and location fields into appropriate formats, ensuring the data would be ready for analysis later. What’s Next? Now that the data is cleaned and ready, the next phase is to start analyzing it. In the second part of this blog series, I’ll walk you through how I explored storm patterns, their impacts, and what these insights tell us about future preparedness.\nWant to dig deeper?
